# Locale

We provide some regional profiles

```js
  import {locale} from "better-datepicker"
  import zhCn from 'better-datepicker/dist/locale_es/zh-cn'    // es
  //require('better-datepicker/dist/locale_umd/zh-cn') // cjs
  locale(zhCn)
```

or you can add it yourself, pull request

```js
  const localeConfig = {
     name: "en",
     weekStart: 0,
     yearStart: 1,
     weekdays: ["Su", "Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr", "Sa"],
     months: ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"],
     yearFormat: "yyyy",
